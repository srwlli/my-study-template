## [2025-09-15] - Mobile Hydration Fix

### Fixed
- **Mobile Hydration Error**: Resolved hydration mismatches in LoginForm component that were causing errors on mobile devices
  - Added mounted state pattern to prevent SSR/client mismatches
  - Added `autoComplete="email"` and `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to email input
  - Added `autoComplete="current-password"` and `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to password input
  - Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to remember me checkbox
  - Implemented loading skeleton during component initialization to prevent flash of unstyled content

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Browser autofill behavior on mobile devices caused server-rendered empty inputs to mismatch client-side autofilled inputs
- **Solution**: Comprehensive mounted state pattern similar to the fix used in `useIsMobile` hook
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/auth/login-form.tsx`
