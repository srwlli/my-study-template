## [2025-09-15] - Vercel Deployment Build Fixes & Mobile Hydration

### Fixed
- **Vercel Deployment Build Failures**: Resolved build errors on Vercel due to missing Supabase environment variables
  - Updated `src/lib/supabase.ts` to use fallback values during build time (`placeholder.supabase.co`, `placeholder-key`)
  - Added `isSupabaseConfigured()` function to check for proper configuration
  - Updated `src/lib/auth-context.tsx` to skip auth initialization when Supabase is not configured
  - Added configuration checks to all auth methods (signIn, signUp, signOut, resetPassword)
  - Fixed theme provider import from `next-themes/dist/types` to `next-themes`
  - Removed unused imports to eliminate ESLint warnings

### Added
- **Graceful Environment Handling**: App now builds successfully even without Supabase environment variables
- **Build Safety Features**: Comprehensive fallback system for missing external service configuration
- **Production Deployment Guide**: Updated setup instructions with Vercel deployment guidance

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Supabase client was throwing errors at module load time when environment variables were missing
- **Solution**: Implemented placeholder values and configuration checks to prevent build failures
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added fallback configuration and isSupabaseConfigured function
  - `src/lib/auth-context.tsx` - Added configuration checks to prevent auth initialization without proper setup
  - `src/components/ui/theme-provider.tsx` - Fixed import path for ThemeProviderProps
  - `src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` - Removed unused SidebarGroupLabel import
  - `src/middleware.ts` - Removed unused NextRequest import

## [2025-09-15] - Mobile Hydration Fix

### Fixed
- **Mobile Hydration Error**: Resolved hydration mismatches in LoginForm component that were causing errors on mobile devices
  - Added mounted state pattern to prevent SSR/client mismatches
  - Added `autoComplete="email"` and `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to email input
  - Added `autoComplete="current-password"` and `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to password input
  - Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to remember me checkbox
  - Implemented loading skeleton during component initialization to prevent flash of unstyled content

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Browser autofill behavior on mobile devices caused server-rendered empty inputs to mismatch client-side autofilled inputs
- **Solution**: Comprehensive mounted state pattern similar to the fix used in `useIsMobile` hook
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/auth/login-form.tsx`
